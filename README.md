# Species-Identification
Species can be precisely identified using **DNA barcoding and Camera Trap Images**, which helps with biodiversity monitoring and preservation. This knowledge is essential for assessing ecosystem health, identifying threatened species, and developing successful conservation plans.

# How we built it
-We first collected the relevant data from online resources.
-Then we cleaned the data for further processing.
-Then we built and trained a variety of Machine Learning models such as SVM, Logistic Regression Model, Naive Bayes etc and compared their accuracies.
-As the **Logistic Regression Model** produced the highest accuracy, we utilize it to accurately predict the species from a given DNA sequence. 
-We also use **Convolutional Neural Networks** to accuratley predict species from given camera trap images.
-Lastly we built a frontend *Web Application* using HTML and CSS in order to ensure that it is easily accessible to users.
